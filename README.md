This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router v6 where the `useParams` hook returns `undefined` when used outside of a component rendered by a route element. The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation leading to this error. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`, illustrating how to correctly access route parameters within a component rendered by a route.
